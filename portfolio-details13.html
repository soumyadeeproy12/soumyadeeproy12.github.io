              This is more of a strategic <b>DeFi trader </b>kind of execution. Firstly at data collection phase, more  <b>67+ DeFi</b> procotols are researched including lending, Yield aggregators along with their satefy history and the network that they're built on,<b> historical APY/APR</b> trend. By collecting these data a <b>safety score </b>is formed.<b> APY</b> is kept as 2nd variable and finally the availibility of that particular<b>liquidity</b> on a protocol is kept as 3rd variable. Then they system is put into an <b>weight matrix </b>intialization with 35-30-35 ratio and PSO optimization algorithm set up is build to get the optimal weights for high yield generation. The DeFi protocols currently in use are mainly<b> L2 protocols.</b> This strategy was generating around 17% till May 2022. Now it's generating <b> 10.72% </b>on average variable APY excluding all gas fees.

            <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
              The <b>Volatile coin(95% ETH)</b> was put under <b>straddle options strategy</b>( buy put and call 7:3) and then stake the ETH to a staking protocol with higher APY.The strategy works like that if ETH goes down, there should not be any loss and if eth goes up, that positioned should be long and on the expirary day if the gas fees are included and the change of ETH price is significant than the strike price, another staking position is opened after the executing the buy call.

              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
                In this strategy, the Idea is to utilize the Uniswap V3 LPs with optimal positioning of the ticks( liquidity essentially). Uniswap V3 introduces the option of choosing the real reserve range which will provide the possible range where the chances of trade happens. The historical data of <b> USDC-USDT</b> and <b>USDC-ETH</b> of ethereum network based pools are collected and APYs are simulted at different time periods for a year with different Prices and ticks, and those simulations where then went through genetic algorithms. The USDT-USDC pool generated around 5-6% whereas ETH-USDC pool can geenration <b>65% + APR</b>. Price flucctuation is an exposure with volatile pool, that's why currently a <b>2-frame based system</b> is getting tested where, ETH/USDC momentum tracing will be happening over one exchange and acoording to the trend changing percentage, in uniswap, a particular tick range positions will be opened and previous one will be closed.
